# Stock-Market-Prediction-with-LSTM
This project utilizes LSTM to predict stock prices. Trained on historical data, it forecasts future prices. Gain insights into potential market trends. So project implements a stock market prediction model using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The LSTM model is trained on historical stock market data to forecast future stock prices. By analyzing patterns and trends in the historical data, the model aims to provide insights into potential future stock price movements.

## Dataset

The stock market prediction model requires historical stock market data as input. You can obtain historical stock price data from various sources, such as Yahoo Finance or other financial data providers. The dataset should include information such as the stock symbol, date, and closing price.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- TensorFlow (version 2.0 or higher)
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Download or obtain the historical stock market dataset in CSV format.
2. Update the code by replacing `'stock_data.csv'` with the path to your dataset file.
3. Run the `stock_prediction_lstm.py` script.

```shell
python stock_prediction_lstm.py
```

## Results

Upon executing the script, the LSTM model will be trained on the historical stock market data. The script will output the following:

- Training progress: Information about the training process, including loss values for each epoch.
- Evaluation results: The model's performance, is typically represented by the mean squared error (MSE) loss on the training and testing datasets.
- Stock price predictions: A plot comparing the predicted and actual stock prices, allowing visual assessment of the model's performance.

## Acknowledgements

- The model implementation is based on the TensorFlow and Keras frameworks.
- Historical stock market data can be obtained from various sources, such as Yahoo Finance.
